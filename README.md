## Hardware + What to Install

Our primary hardware is from Adafruit ([hardware list](https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/457925)). We also have Arduino 101 kits provided
by Intel.

You will need to install the **Arduino IDE** to program the device. Depending on your operating system, you may require drivers for the
**Feather HUZZAH**. Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/using-arduino-ide) to install drivers and run the *Blink Test* and the *Connecting via WiFi* to make sure your system and WiFi are set up correctly.
